# 📜 Statement 1: Fine Print Decoder (RAG System)

## 🎯 Goal
A high-precision **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to decode complex legal jargon from the *Titan Secure Health Insurance Policy* into simple, **"ELI5" (Explain Like I'm Five)** language with 100% source transparency.

## 🌟 Bonus Tasks Completed!
> **Source Attribution & Transparency (+5 Bonus Points Achieved):**  
> We have successfully completed the bonus task! Our bot explicitly cites the **Section, Clause number, and Page Number** for every answer it provides. This ensures extreme transparency, builds user trust, and completely eliminates hallucination when providing answers on critical, high-stakes documents.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The pipeline follows a modular RAG workflow to ensure accuracy and prevent hallucination:

1. **Ingestion**: PDF documents are processed and parsed using PyPDF / LangChain.
2. **Chunking**: Documents are split using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with a chunk size of 1000 and an overlap of 200 to maintain context across clauses.
3. **Embeddings**: Text chunks are converted into numerical vectors using `sentence-transformers` (Local Embeddings).
4. **Vector Store**: Vectors are stored in **ChromaDB** (Persistent Local Storage) for semantic retrieval.
5. **Generation (LLM)**: The system uses Google's Flan-T5-Small to transform retrieved legal text into simplified language.
6. **Source Attribution**: Every response includes metadata extraction to cite the exact Section, Clause, and Page Number.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone & Navigate
First, ensure you are in the specific project directory to avoid path errors with the local database and documents.
```bash
cd Statement-1-Insurance-Decoder
```

### 2. Virtual Environment Setup
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated and avoid `ModuleNotFound` errors.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the core RAG stack (LangChain, ChromaDB, and Sentence-Transformers).
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Environment Variables
The system uses a `.env` file for configuration. 
Open `.env` and ensure the following paths are correct:
- `CHROMA_PATH`: Where your vector data will be saved (default: `./chroma_db`).
- `DATA_PATH`: Where the PDF is located (default: `./docs/`).

## 💻 Usage Guide

### Step 1: Ingest the Policy
Before you can ask questions, the system must "read" the insurance policy and build the vector index.
```bash
python3 decoder.py ingest
```

### Step 2: Start the Application Server
Launch the FastAPI Web UI:
```bash
python3 decoder.py serve
```
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to start decoding!
